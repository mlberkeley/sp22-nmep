# Spring 2022 NMEP Homework and Syllabus

Welcome to NMEP! This simple hub will give you access to the schedules, slides, syllabus, research papers, and homework.

## Homeworks and Submission

Homeworks will be pushed weekly on Mondays after lecture. Please pull new changes and complete the assignments by the following Monday (due 7:59 pm). We will upload a Gradescope assignment for each homework by the following monday. Please export your files as a pdf and submit to the corresponding assignment.
